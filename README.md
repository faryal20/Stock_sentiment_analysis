Stock Sentiment Analysis from News Headlines using Machine Learning
In this Project, i have taken the dataset from the kaggel. Then, i cleaned up the data by removing the duplicate or irrelevant and unwanted observations. i made the text lowercase. As, NLP is a case-sensitive. i removed the line breaks, punctuation by using the string libray. After that, i used NLTK library for removing the stop words. Then, i removed numbers and extra spaces and implemented the process of stemming or lemmatization. I used Count vector after cleaning the data because Count vector is a text proprocessing technique commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks for converting a collection of text documents into a numerical representation. It is a part of the Scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library in python. Then, I implemented Bag of words for describing the occurance of word counts and discarded the information about the grammetical details and the word order in the data news of stock market. After that, I implemented Random Forest Classifier for solving the classification problem. This can predict the test data of the stock market data whether it is positive, negative or neutral. Then in the last step of this project, check the accuracy of the predicted data by implenting the metrics library.
