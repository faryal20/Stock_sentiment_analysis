Stock Sentiment Analysis from News Headlines using Machine Learning
In this Project, i have taken the dataset from the kaggel. Then, i cleaned the data by removing the duplicate or irrelevant and unwanted observations. i made the text lowercase. As, NLP is a case-sensitive. i emoved the line breaks, punctuation by using the string libray. After that, i used NLTK library for removing the stop words. Then, i removed numbers and extra spaces and implemented the process of stemming or lemmatization.
