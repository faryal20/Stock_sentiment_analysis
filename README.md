Stock Sentiment Analysis from News Headlines using Machine Learning
In this Project, i have taken the dataset from the kaggel. Then, i cleaned up the data by removing the duplicate or irrelevant and unwanted observations. i made the text lowercase. As, NLP is a case-sensitive. i removed the line breaks, punctuation by using the string libray. After that, i used NLTK library for removing the stop words. Then, i removed numbers and extra spaces and implemented the process of stemming or lemmatization. I used Count vector after cleaning the data because Count vector is a text proprocessing technique commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks for converting a collection of text documents into a numerical representation. It is a part of the Scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library in python. Then, I implemented Bag of words for describing the occurance of word counts and discarded the information about the grammetical details and the word order.
